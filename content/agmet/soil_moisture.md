# Soil Moisture (Surface):

Surface Soil Moisture measures the amount of available water held in the top five-to-ten 
centimeters of the soil (depth dependent on soil texture). The plot shows the current season’s 
values as compared to the 5-year mean, values from the previous season, and the 10-year minimum 
and maximum values. Up to a maximum of 25 millimeters (mm) of available water is able to be held 
in the surface soil. Higher soil moisture values during the early development stage help crops 
to germinate and grow. Mid-range soil moisture values during the season help promote crop growth 
and root depth. However, lower values typically any time before senescence can cause stress in 
the crops and stunt development.
