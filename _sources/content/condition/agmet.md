# Agrometeorological Earth Observation Indicators

The Agrometeorological (AgMet) Earth Observations (EO) Indicators bring together a variety 
of Earth Observation (EO) data products on the sub-national scale, each of which provides 
valuable insights on in-season crop development and current crop conditions. Combined, the 
different EO data plots help tell the story of in-season crop conditions thought the use of
different climate, environmental, and vegetative variables

## AgMet EO Indicators Explained

The GEOGLAM-NASA Harvest Agrometeorological (AGMET) Earth Observation (EO) Indicators bring 
together a variety of Earth Observation (EO) data products on the sub-national scale, each of 
which provides valuable insights on in-season crop development and current crop conditions. 
Combined, each EO data plot helps tell the story of in-season crop conditions through the 
use of different climate, environmental, and vegetative variables. Detailed descriptions of 
the different components within the crop condition plots can be found below and in the 
corresponding NASA Harvest article. 

Further in-depth discussion on different EO data products for crop monitoring see 
[EO Data](https://cropmonitor.org/index.php/eodatatools/eodata/).

## EO data plot components

### Basic components:

Within each plot, there are several main components. The light gray area shows the span of 
most recent 10-year minimum and maximum values across the season in order to provide a better 
understanding of the particular EO data productâ€™s variability over time. The black lines 
show the most recent 5-year mean values across the season in order to demonstrate what 
average conditions usually represent. The purple lines show what the values were across 
the previous season. The blue lines show what the values are for the current season in 
near real-time as the season progresses.

### Crop Calendars:

Each plot consists of four vertical lines to provide a reference for where crops are in 
the development stage, based on the GEOGLAM Crop Monitor crop calendars. The brown dotted 
line represents the planting stage, the green solid line represents greenup 
(the beginning of plant growth), the brown solid line represents senescence 
(late development stage), and the red dotted line represents the end of harvest. 
By examining the main components of each plot within the context of where crops are in 
their development cycle, analysts can better interpret how current conditions may impact 
the remainder of the season and final crop outcomes.
