# Crop Condition Analysis 

The GEOGLAM-NASA Harvest Agrometeorological [AgMet](https://cropmonitor.org/tools/agmet/) Earth Observation Indicators utilize a wealth 
of Earth observation data to provide valuable insights on in-season crop development and current crop conditions at the sub-national scale. 
Each AGMET Indicator consists of several EO data plots that quantify critical indicators of crop health for a specific region over the 
cropping season. The AGMET Indicators are being produced for all GEOGLAM Crop Monitor countries and are updated every 7-12 days to ensure 
that users are provided with the most up-to-date information.


Here we examine how to put together a basic crop condition analysis using the AgMet Indicators and related graphics.
