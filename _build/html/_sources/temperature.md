# Temperature

There are two plots for temperature, both of which are measured in degrees Celsius. The first 
plot tracks the maximum daily temperature values while the second plot tracks minimum daily 
temperatures. Both plots show the current season’s values as compared to the 5-year mean, 
values from the previous season, and the 10-year minimum and maximum values. Very high 
temperatures can affect crops in a number of ways such as the increase of water loss through 
increased evapotranspiration, slow plant growth, reduce yields, pollen abortion, and potentially 
thermal death. Very low temperatures can also affect crops through the slowing in crop growth, 
frost or chilling injury, reduced seed quality, and possible yield reductions.
