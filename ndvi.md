# Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI):

There are two plots for NDVI. The first plot shows the NDVI values for the current season in 
comparison to the 5-year mean, values from the previous season, and the 10-year minimum and 
maximum values. As a crop season progresses, NDVI values will increase during early crop growth 
and development of leafy vegetation. NDVI will then reach the peak as the crop fully develops 
and reaches maturity, before senescence, and then decreases again as the crop matures and 
senesces as the leafy vegetation begins to die off. How the NDVI values progress over the 
course of the season and the individual peak values can help predict the productivity of the 
crops. The second NDVI plot shows the comparison of the current season NDVI values with the 
previous five seasons along with the resulting average crop yields from those seasons.
